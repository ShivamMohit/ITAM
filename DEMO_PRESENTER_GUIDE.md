# Demo Presenter Quick Reference Guide

## ðŸŽ¤ Key Talking Points & Script Hooks

### Opening Hook (0:00 - 0:30)
**"Imagine having complete visibility into every IT asset in your organization - from laptops to servers - and the ability to keep them all secure and updated automatically. That's exactly what our ITAM and Patch Management systems deliver."**

### ITAM Value Proposition (1:00 - 1:30)
**"The ITAM system eliminates the manual inventory nightmare. Instead of spreadsheets and guesswork, you get automated hardware detection, real-time asset tracking, and complete user assignment management."**

### Patch Management Value Proposition (8:00 - 8:30)
**"While ITAM gives you visibility, Patch Management gives you control. Security patches are detected automatically, prioritized by severity, and deployed with approval workflows that ensure nothing breaks."**

### Integration Benefits (15:00 - 15:30)
**"The real power comes when these systems work together. You discover an asset, scan its hardware, monitor its patch status, and deploy updates - all from a single, integrated platform."**
