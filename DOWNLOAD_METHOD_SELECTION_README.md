# Browser-Only Download Feature

## Overview

The ITAM system now provides direct browser downloads for all files (scanner packages and CSV exports). IDM (Internet Download Manager) functionality has been completely removed to ensure consistent download behavior across all systems.

## How It Works

### Scanner Downloads
- **Browser Download**: Downloads the scanner package directly to your browser's default download folder
- **No IDM Support**: IDM integration has been removed for simplified download experience

### CSV Exports
- **Browser Download**: Exports data directly to CSV and downloads to your browser
- **No IDM Support**: IDM integration has been removed for simplified export experience

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components
- `ScannerDownloadModal.js`: Simplified to only show platform selection and download button
- `admin/page.js`: Direct CSV export calls without download method selection
- `downloadUtils.js`: Simplified utility functions for browser-only downloads

### Backend Changes
- `scanner.controller.js`: Always uses browser download method with minimal headers
- `scanner.route.js`: Maintains platform parameter support for flexibility

### Download Method
All downloads now use the same approach:
1. **Response Type**: Frontend API calls use `responseType: "blob"`
2. **Headers**: Backend sends minimal headers to ensure browser-native downloads
3. **Stream Response**: Files are sent as streams for efficient download

## Usage Examples

### Scanner Download
```javascript
// Browser download (only option)
const response = await scannerAPI.downloadScanner('windows');
const blob = new Blob([response.data], { type: "application/zip" });
// ... download logic
```

### CSV Export
```javascript
// Direct CSV export to browser
exportTicketsToCSV(tickets, 'tickets_report');
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified UX**: No confusing download method selection
2. **Consistent Behavior**: All downloads work the same way across systems
3. **No IDM Dependencies**: Works on any system without external software
4. **Reliable Downloads**: Browser-native downloads are more reliable

## Technical Requirements

- **Frontend**: React 18+, modern browser support
- **Backend**: Node.js 16+, Express.js
- **File Types**: ZIP archives, CSV exports
- **No External Dependencies**: No IDM or other download managers required

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: All downloads require valid authentication tokens
- **Tenant Isolation**: Downloads are filtered by tenant ID
- **File Validation**: Generated files are validated before download
- **Secure Headers**: Appropriate security headers for file downloads

## Future Enhancements

1. **Download Progress**: Real-time progress indicators
2. **Batch Downloads**: Multiple file downloads
3. **Download History**: Track download history and preferences
4. **Custom Download Locations**: User-defined download paths

## Troubleshooting

### Download Issues
**Problem**: Downloads not working or files corrupted.

**Solution**: The system now uses a simplified approach:
- All downloads use browser-native mechanisms
- No external download manager interference
- Consistent response headers across all downloads

**Technical Details**:
- Backend always sends `Content-Type: application/zip` for scanner downloads
- Frontend uses `responseType: "blob"` for all downloads
- Files are streamed directly to the browser

### Common Issues
1. **Download not starting**: Check browser download settings and permissions
2. **File corruption**: Verify network stability and retry download
3. **Authentication errors**: Ensure user is properly logged in

## Support

For technical support with downloads:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify browser download settings
3. Test with different browsers
4. Contact system administrator for backend issues

## Migration Notes

**From Previous Version**: If you were using IDM downloads:
- All downloads now go directly to your browser
- No more download method selection
- Simpler and more reliable download experience
- No need to install or configure IDM
